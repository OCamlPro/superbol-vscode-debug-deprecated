An extension to debug or execute GnuCOBOL code. Forked from [COBOL Degub](https://github.com/OlegKunitsyn/gnucobol-debug).

### Features
* Setting breakpoints
* Continue, Stop, Restart, Step Over, Step Into, Step Out
* Variables pane, including Copy Value, Copy as Expression and Add to Watch
* Watch pane with expressions
* Code coverage
* No mainframe required

### Requirements
This extension is meant to work with our COBOL language extension [Superbol VSCode](https://github.com/OCamlPro/superbol-vscode-platform).

#### Binaries
* GnuCOBOL `cobc` 3.1+ installed.
* GNU Debugger `gdb` 13.0+ installed.

### Usage
When your `launch.json` config is set up, you can debug or execute your COBOL program. If you debug a Compilation Group (main- and sub- programs), you need to list sub-programs inside `group` property. Here's an example:
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "COBOL debugger",
            "type": "gdb",
            "request": "launch",
            "cobcargs": ["-free", "-x"],
            "group": ["subsample.cbl", "subsubsample.cbl"]
        }
    ]
}
```

Pick `COBOL debugger` from the dropdown on the Debug pane in VS Code. Press the Play button or `F5` to debug or `Ctrl+F5` to execute.

The debugger uses C sourcecode generated by the compiler upon each debugging session. If the sourcemap isn't accurate or you see any other issues, please make a bug-report.

### Code coverage
You can estimate an execution flow of your COBOL program.

![Coverage](coverage.png)

Set `coverage` property to `true` in your `launch.json` and start debugging session. Here's an example:
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "COBOL debugger",
            "type": "gdb",
            "request": "launch",
            "cobcargs": ["-free", "-x"],
            "coverage": true
        }
    ]
}
```

The extension decodes the code-coverage files in `gcov` format generated by the compiler.

### Attaching to a running process
You may debug your COBOL program attaching to a running process. In order to achieve that, you have two options:

#### Local Process
Add `pid` property to your `launch.json` and start debugging session (you can use a input variable to help like the sample below). 
Here's an example:
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "COBOL debugger attach",
            "type": "gdb",
            "request": "attach",
            "cobcargs": ["-free", "-x"],
            "pid": "${input:pid}"
        }
    ],
    "inputs": [
        {
            "id": "pid",
            "type": "promptString",
            "description": "PID to attach"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Remote Debugger (GDBServer)
Add `remoteDebugger` property to your `launch.json`.

Here's an example:
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "COBOL debugger attach",
            "type": "gdb",
            "request": "attach",
            "cobcargs": ["-free", "-x"],
            "remoteDebugger": "localhost:5555"
        }
    ]
}
```

Your contribution is always welcome!

### Troubleshooting
Add `verbose` property to your `launch.json` and start debugging session. In `DEBUG CONSOLE` you will see complete communication log between `gdb` and VS Code. Here's an example:
```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "COBOL debugger",
            "type": "gdb",
            "request": "launch",
            "cobcargs": ["-free", "-x"],
            "verbose": true
        }
    ]
}
```

### Development
* Fork the repository.
* Clone it to your machine and open with VS Code.
* Install dependencies by `yarn install` command in the terminal.
* Pick `Extension` from the dropdown on the Debug pane and press `F5`. This will open new VS Code instance with your cloned extension in debugging mode.
* Follow Requirements and Usage sections above.
* In the first VS Code instance you may put breakpoints to explore the functionality.
* Stop the second VS Code instance and implement your idea in TypeScript.
* Pick `Tests` from the dropdown on the Debug pane and press `F5`. Keep them green.
* Push your changes and create Pull Request to the original repository.
